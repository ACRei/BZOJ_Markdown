## 题目描述

Farmer John has just arranged his NN haybales (1&le;N&le;100,0001&le;N&le;100,000) at various points along t

he one-dimensional road running across his farm. To make sure they are spaced out appropriately, ple

ase help him answer QQ queries (1&le;Q&le;100,0001&le;Q&le;100,000), each asking for the number of haybales 

within a specific interval along the road.

给出N（1&le;N&le;100,000）个数，和   Q（1&le;Q&le;100,000）个询问。每个询问包含两个整数A,B(0&le;A&le;B&le;1,000,00

0,000）。对于每个询问，给出数值在A到B间的数有多少个（包含A与B）。

## 输入格式

The first line contains N and Q.The next line contains N distinct integers, each in the range 0&hellip;1,0

00,000,000 indicating that there is a haybale at each of those locations.Each of the next Q lines co

ntains two integers AA and BB (0&le;A&le;B&le;1,000,000,000) giving a query for the number of haybales bet

ween A and B, inclusive.

## 输出格式

write Q lines of output. For each query, output the number of haybales in its respective interval.
