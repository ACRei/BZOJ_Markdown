## 题目描述

You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with n nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to n. 

Each node has a color, white or black. All the nodes are black initially.

We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:

- 0 u : ask for how many nodes are connected to u, two nodes are connected iff all the node on the path from u to v (inclusive u and v) have a same color. 
- 1 u : toggle the color of u(that is, from black to white, or from white to black). 

## 输入格式

The first line contains a number n denoted how many nodes in the tree(1&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;n&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;105). The next n&thinsp;-&thinsp;1 lines, each line has two numbers (u,&thinsp; v) describe a edge of the tree(1&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;u,&thinsp; v&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;n). The next line contains a number m denoted how many operations we are going to process(1&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;m&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;105). The next m lines, each line describe a operation (t,&thinsp; u) as we mentioned above(0&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;t&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;1, 1&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;u&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;n).

## 输出格式

 

For each query operation, output the corresponding result.
