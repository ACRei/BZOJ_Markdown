## 题目描述

I have a set of super poker cards, consisting of an infinite number of cards. For each positive integer p, there are exactly 
four cards whose value is p: Spade(S), Heart(H), Club(C) and Diamond(D). There are no cards of other values. 
 
Given two positive integers n and k, how many ways can you pick up at most k cards whose values sum to n? For 
example, if n=15 and k=3, one way is 3H + 4S + 8H, shown below:

## 输入格式

There will be at most 20 test cases, each with two integers n and k (1<=n<=10 , 1<=k<=10). The input is terminated by 
n=k=0. 

## 输出格式

For each test case, print the number of ways, modulo 1,000,000,009.
