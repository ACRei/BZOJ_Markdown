## 题目描述

Farmer John's N cows are standing in a row, as they have a tendency to do from time to time. Each cow is labeled with a distinct integer ID number so FJ can tell them apart. FJ would like to take a photo of a contiguous group of cows but, due to a traumatic childhood incident involving the numbers 1&hellip;6, he only wants to take a picture of a group of cows if their IDs add up to a multiple of 7.

Please help FJ determine the size of the largest group he can photograph.

The first line of input contains N(1&le;N&le;50,000). The next N lines each contain the N integer IDs of the cows (all are in the range 0&hellip;1,000,000

).

给定长度为N的数列A，求A最长的连续子序列，满足子序列中元素的和是7的倍数。输出最大的长度。如果不存在满

足条件的子序列，输出0。1 &le; N &le; 50000, 0 &le; A_i &le; 10 ^ 6

## 输入格式

Please output the number of cows in the largest consecutive group whose IDs sum to a multiple of 7. If no such group exists, output 0.

## 输出格式

You may want to note that the sum of the IDs of a large group of cows might be too large to fit into a standard 32-bit integer. If you are summing up large groups of IDs, you may therefore want to use a larger integer data type, like a 64-bit "long long" in C/C++.
