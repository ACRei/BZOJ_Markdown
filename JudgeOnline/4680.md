内存限制：64 MiB时间限制：2 Sec

## 题目描述

As we know, Rikka is poor at math. At the test, Rikka finds that she cannot even do a single problem. There is one of the insane problems:

Given an integer K, she needs to come up with an n&times;n 01 matrix A and an integer m which meet B1,n=K, where B=Am.

It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?

输入k，输出一个n*n的有向图，使从1走m条边到n的路径数正好为k

## 输入格式

The first line of the input is a single integer T (T=40), indicating the number of testcases. 

Each of the next T lines contains one integer K (0&le;K&le;10^18). 

## 输出格式

For each testcase, the first line contains two space-separated integers n,m (1&le;n,m&le;30).

In each of following n lines print n characters (0 or 1) - the matrix A you find.
