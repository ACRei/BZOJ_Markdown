## 题目描述

ZCC loves playing cards. He has n magical cards and each has a number on it. He wants to choose k cards and place them around in any order to form a circle. He can choose any several consecutive cards the number of which is m(1<=m<=k) to play a magic. The magic is simple that ZCC can get a number x=a1&oplus;a2...&oplus;am, which ai means the number on the ith card he chooses. He can play the magic infinite times, but once he begin to play the magic, he can&rsquo;t change anything in the card circle including the order.

ZCC has a lucky number L. ZCC want to obtain the number L~R by using one card circle. And if he can get other numbers which aren&rsquo;t in the range [L,R], it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Help him to find the maximal R.

## 输入格式

The input contains several test cases.The first line in each case contains three integers n, k and L(k&le;n&le;20,1&le;k&le;6,1&le;L&le;100). The next line contains n numbers means the numbers on the n cards. The ith number a[i] satisfies 1&le;a[i]&le;100.

You can assume that all the test case generated randomly.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the maximal number R. And if L can&rsquo;t be obtained, output 0.
