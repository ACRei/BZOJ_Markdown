    INPUT DETAILS:
    
    Four clumps: at 1, 9, 11, and 19. Bessie starts at location 10.
    
    

### 样例输出

    
    
    44
    
    OUTPUT DETAILS:
    
    Bessie can follow this route:
    
    * start at position 10 at time 0
    * move to position 9, arriving at time 1
    * move to position 11, arriving at time 3
    * move to position 19, arriving at time 11
    * move to position 1, arriving at time 29
    
    giving her a total staleness of 1+3+11+29 = 44.  There are other routes
    with the same total staleness, but no route with a smaller one.
