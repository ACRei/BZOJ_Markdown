## 题目描述

Bulls are so much better at math than the cows. They can multiply
huge integers together and get perfectly precise answers ... or so
they say. Farmer John wonders if their answers are correct. Help
him check the bulls' answers. Read in two positive integers (no
more than 40 digits each) and compute their product.  Output it as
a normal number (with no extra leading zeros).

FJ asks that you do this yourself; don't use a special library
function for the multiplication.
